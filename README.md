# KIDRSA

Algorithm to use encryption that's basic forms of RSA. Basically, it takes 4 input values that "Alice" decides to send to "Bob." 
Those values come up with the rest of the encryption variables to encrypt and decrypt the values.

The algorithm works by getting the ASCII value of the characters input and multiplying it by whatever value comes out as the keys from A, B, C, D. These four numbers mathmatically create a system that normal humans find computationally intensive but is somewhat easy for machines to break in these small numbers.

If we multiply each number by a new number to where the new keys are extremely long, it becomes significantly more computationally intensive for computers to run.
